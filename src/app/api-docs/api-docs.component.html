  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In general terms, a blockchain is an immutable transaction ledger, maintained
    within a distributed network of <em>peer nodes</em>. These nodes each maintain a copy
    of the ledger by applying transactions that have been validated by a <em>consensus
      protocol</em>, grouped into blocks that include a hash that bind each block to the
    preceding block.</p>
  <p>The first and most widely recognized application of blockchain is the
    Bitcion cryptocurrency,
    though others
    have followed in its footsteps. Ethereum, an alternative cryptocurrency, took a
    different approach, integrating many of the same characteristics as Bitcoin but
    adding <em>smart contracts</em> to create a platform for distributed applications.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum fall into a class of blockchain that we would classify as
    <em>public permissionless</em> blockchain technology. Basically, these are public
    networks, open to anyone, where participants interact anonymously.</p>
  <p>As the popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and a few other derivative technologies
    grew, interest in applying the underlying technology of the blockchain,
    distributed ledger and distributed application platform to more innovative
    <em>enterprise</em> use cases also grew. However, many enterprise use cases require
    performance characteristics that the permissionless blockchain technologies are
    unable (presently) to deliver. In addition, in many use cases, the identity of
    the participants is a hard requirement, such as in the case of financial
    transactions where Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
    regulations must be followed.</p>
  <p>For enterprise use, we need to consider the following requirements:</p>
  <ul class="simple">
    <li>Participants must be identified/identifiable</li>
    <li>Networks need to be <em>permissioned</em></li>
    <li>High transaction throughput performance</li>
    <li>Low latency of transaction confirmation</li>
    <li>Privacy and confidentiality of transactions and data pertaining to business
      transactions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While many early blockchain platforms are currently being <em>adapted</em> for
    enterprise use, Hyperledger Fabric has been <em>designed</em> for enterprise use from
    the outset. The following sections describe how Hyperledger Fabric (Fabric)
    differentiates itself from other blockchain platforms and describes some of the
    motivation for its architectural decisions.</p>
  <div class="section" id="hyperledger-fabric">
    <span id="hyperledger-fabric"></span>
    <h2>Hyperledger Fabric</h2>
    <p>Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed
      ledger technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in enterprise contexts,
      that delivers some key differentiating capabilities over other popular
      distributed ledger or blockchain platforms.</p>
    <p>One key point of differentiation is that Hyperledger was established under the
      Linux Foundation, which itself has a long and very successful history of
      nurturing open source projects under <strong>open governance</strong> that grow strong
      sustaining communities and thriving ecosystems. Hyperledger is governed by a
      diverse technical steering committee, and the Hyperledger Fabric project by a
      diverse set of maintainers from multiple organizations. It has a development
      community that has grown to over 35 organizations and nearly 200 developers
      since its earliest commits.</p>
    <p>Fabric has a highly <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>configurable</strong> architecture, enabling
      innovation, versatility and optimization for a broad range of industry use cases
      including banking, finance, insurance, healthcare, human resources, supply
      chain and even digital music delivery.</p>
    <p>Fabric is the first distributed ledger platform to support <strong>smart contracts
        authored in general-purpose programming languages</strong> such as Java, Go and
      Node.js, rather than constrained domain-specific languages (DSL). This means
      that most enterprises already have the skill set needed to develop smart
      contracts, and no additional training to learn a new language or DSL is needed.</p>
    <p>The Fabric platform is also <strong>permissioned</strong>, meaning that, unlike with a public
      permissionless network, the participants are known to each other, rather than
      anonymous and therefore fully untrusted. This means that while the participants
      may not <em>fully</em> trust one another (they may, for example, be competitors in the
      same industry), a network can be operated under a governance model that is built
      off of what trust <em>does</em> exist between participants, such as a legal agreement
      or framework for handling disputes.</p>
    <p>One of the most important of the platform’s differentiators is its support for
      <strong>pluggable consensus protocols</strong> that enable the platform to be more
      effectively customized to fit particular use cases and trust models. For
      instance, when deployed within a single enterprise, or operated by a trusted
      authority, fully byzantine fault tolerant consensus might be considered
      unnecessary and an excessive drag on performance and throughput. In situations
      such as that, a
      crash
      fault-tolerant (CFT)
      consensus protocol might be more than adequate whereas, in a multi-party,
      decentralized use case, a more traditional
      byzantine
      fault tolerant
      (BFT) consensus protocol might be required.</p>
    <p>Fabric can leverage consensus protocols that <strong>do not require a native
        cryptocurrency</strong> to incent costly mining or to fuel smart contract execution.
      Avoidance of a cryptocurrency reduces some significant risk/attack vectors,
      and absence of cryptographic mining operations means that the platform can be
      deployed with roughly the same operational cost as any other distributed system.</p>
    <p>The combination of these differentiating design features makes Fabric one of
      the <strong>better performing platforms</strong> available today both in terms of transaction
      processing and transaction confirmation latency, and it enables <strong>privacy and
        confidentiality</strong> of transactions and the smart contracts (what Fabric calls
      “chaincode”) that implement them.</p>
    <p>Let’s explore these differentiating features in more detail.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="modularity">
    <span id="modularity"></span>
    <h2>Modularity</h2>
    <p>Hyperledger Fabric has been specifically architected to have a modular
      architecture. Whether it is pluggable consensus, pluggable identity management
      protocols such as LDAP or OpenID Connect, key management protocols or
      cryptographic libraries, the platform has been designed at its core to be
      configured to meet the diversity of enterprise use case requirements.</p>
    <p>At a high level, Fabric is comprised of the following modular components:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>A pluggable <em>ordering service</em> establishes consensus on the order of
        transactions and then broadcasts blocks to peers.</li>
      <li>A pluggable <em>membership service provider</em> is responsible for associating
        entities in the network with cryptographic identities.</li>
      <li>An optional <em>peer-to-peer gossip service</em> disseminates the blocks output by
        ordering service to other peers.</li>
      <li>Smart contracts (“chaincode”) run within a container environment (e.g. Docker)
        for isolation. They can be written in standard programming languages but do not
        have direct access to the ledger state.</li>
      <li>The ledger can be configured to support a variety of DBMSs.</li>
      <li>A pluggable endorsement and validation policy enforcement that can be
        independently configured per application.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is fair agreement in the industry that there is no “one blockchain to
      rule them all”. Hyperledger Fabric can be configured in multiple ways to
      satisfy the diverse solution requirements for multiple industry use cases.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="permissioned-vs-permissionless-blockchains">
    <span id="permissioned-vs-permissionless-blockchains"></span>
    <h2>Permissioned vs Permissionless Blockchains</h2>
    <p>In a permissionless blockchain, virtually anyone can participate, and every
      participant is anonymous. In such a context, there can be no trust other than
      that the state of the blockchain, prior to a certain depth, is immutable. In
      order to mitigate this absence of trust, permissionless blockchains typically
      employ a “mined” native cryptocurrency or transaction fees to provide economic
      incentive to offset the extraordinary costs of participating in a form of
      byzantine fault tolerant consensus based on “proof of work” (PoW).</p>
    <p><strong>Permissioned</strong> blockchains, on the other hand, operate a blockchain amongst
      a set of known, identified and often vetted participants operating under a
      governance model that yields a certain degree of trust. A permissioned
      blockchain provides a way to secure the interactions among a group of entities
      that have a common goal but which may not fully trust each other. By relying on
      the identities of the participants, a permissioned blockchain can use more
      traditional crash fault tolerant (CFT) or byzantine fault tolerant (BFT)
      consensus protocols that do not require costly mining.</p>
    <p>Additionally, in such a permissioned context, the risk of a participant
      intentionally introducing malicious code through a smart contract is diminished.
      First, the participants are known to one another and all actions, whether
      submitting application transactions, modifying the configuration of the network
      or deploying a smart contract are recorded on the blockchain following an
      endorsement policy that was established for the network and relevant transaction
      type. Rather than being completely anonymous, the guilty party can be easily
      identified and the incident handled in accordance with the terms of the
      governance model.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="smart-contracts">
    <span id="smart-contracts"></span>
    <h2>Smart Contracts
    </h2>
    <p>A smart contract, or what Fabric calls “chaincode”, functions as a trusted
      distributed application that gains its security/trust from the blockchain and
      the underlying consensus among the peers. It is the business logic of a
      blockchain application.</p>
    <p>There are three key points that apply to smart contracts, especially when
      applied to a platform:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>many smart contracts run concurrently in the network,</li>
      <li>they may be deployed dynamically (in many cases by anyone), and</li>
      <li>application code should be treated as untrusted, potentially even
        malicious.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most existing smart-contract capable blockchain platforms follow an
      <strong>order-execute</strong> architecture in which the consensus protocol:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>validates and orders transactions then propagates them to all peer nodes,</li>
      <li>each peer then executes the transactions sequentially.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The order-execute architecture can be found in virtually all existing blockchain
      systems, ranging from public/permissionless platforms such as
      Ethereum (with PoW-based consensus)
      to permissioned
      platforms such as Tendermint,
      Chain, and Quorum.</p>
    <p>Smart contracts executing in a blockchain that operates with the order-execute
      architecture must be deterministic; otherwise, consensus might never be reached.
      To address the non-determinism issue, many platforms require that the smart
      contracts be written in a non-standard, or domain-specific language
      (such as Solidity)
      so that
      non-deterministic operations can be eliminated. This hinders wide-spread
      adoption because it requires developers writing smart contracts to learn a new
      language and may lead to programming errors.</p>
    <p>Further, since all transactions are executed sequentially by all nodes,
      performance and scale is limited. The fact that the smart contract code executes
      on every node in the system demands that complex measures be taken to protect
      the overall system from potentially malicious contracts in order to ensure
      resiliency of the overall system.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="a-new-approach">
    <span id="a-new-approach"></span>
    <h2>A New Approach
    </h2>
    <p>Fabric introduces a new architecture for transactions that we call
      <strong>execute-order-validate</strong>. It addresses the resiliency, flexibility,
      scalability, performance and confidentiality challenges faced by the
      order-execute model by separating the transaction flow into three steps:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li><em>execute</em> a transaction and check its correctness, thereby endorsing it,</li>
      <li><em>order</em> transactions via a (pluggable) consensus protocol, and</li>
      <li><em>validate</em> transactions against an application-specific endorsement policy
        before committing them to the ledger</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This design departs radically from the order-execute paradigm in that Fabric
      executes transactions before reaching final agreement on their order.</p>
    <p>In Fabric, an application-specific endorsement policy specifies which peer
      nodes, or how many of them, need to vouch for the correct execution of a given
      smart contract. Thus, each transaction need only be executed (endorsed) by the
      subset of the peer nodes necessary to satisfy the transaction’s endorsement
      policy. This allows for parallel execution increasing overall performance and
      scale of the system. This first phase also <strong>eliminates any non-determinism</strong>,
      as inconsistent results can be filtered out before ordering.</p>
    <p>Because we have eliminated non-determinism, Fabric is the first blockchain
      technology that <strong>enables use of standard programming languages</strong>. In the 1.1.0
      release, smart contracts can be written in either Go or Node.js, while there are
      plans to support other popular languages including Java in subsequent releases.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="privacy-and-confidentiality">
    <span id="privacy-and-confidentiality"></span>
    <h2>Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>As we have discussed, in a public, permissionless blockchain network that
      leverages PoW for its consensus model, transactions are executed on every node.
      This means that neither can there be confidentiality of the contracts
      themselves, nor of the transaction data that they process. Every transaction,
      and the code that implements it, is visible to every node in the network. In
      this case, we have traded confidentiality of contract and data for byzantine
      fault tolerant consensus delivered by PoW.</p>
    <p>This lack of confidentiality can be problematic for many business/enterprise use
      cases. For example, in a network of supply-chain partners, some consumers might
      be given preferred rates as a means of either solidifying a relationship, or
      promoting additional sales. If every participant can see every contract and
      transaction, it becomes impossible to maintain such business relationships in a
      completely transparent network – everyone will want the preferred rates!</p>
    <p>As a second example, consider the securities industry, where a trader building
      a position (or disposing of one) would not want her competitors to know of this,
      or else they will seek to get in on the game, weakening the trader’s gambit.</p>
    <p>In order to address the lack of privacy and confidentiality for purposes of
      delivering on enterprise use case requirements, blockchain platforms have
      adopted a variety of approaches. All have their trade-offs.</p>
    <p>Encrypting data is one approach to providing confidentiality; however, in a
      permissionless network leveraging PoW for its consensus, the encrypted data is
      sitting on every node. Given enough time and computational resource, the
      encryption could be broken. For many enterprise use cases, the risk that their
      information could become compromised is unacceptable.</p>
    <p>Zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) are another area of research being explored to
      address this problem, the trade-off here being that, presently, computing a ZKP
      requires considerable time and computational resources. Hence, the trade-off in
      this case is performance for confidentiality.</p>
    <p>In a permissioned context that can leverage alternate forms of consensus, one
      might explore approaches that restrict the distribution of confidential
      information exclusively to authorized nodes.</p>
    <p>Hyperledger Fabric, being a permissioned platform, enables confidentiality
      through its channel architecture. Basically, participants on a Fabric network
      can establish a “channel” between the subset of participants that should be
      granted visibility to a particular set of transactions. Think of this as a
      network overlay. Thus, only those nodes that participate in a channel have
      access to the smart contract (chaincode) and data transacted, preserving the
      privacy and confidentiality of both.</p>
    <p>To improve upon its privacy and confidentiality capabilities, Fabric has
      added support for private
      data and is working
      on zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) available in the future. More on this as it
      becomes available.</p>
